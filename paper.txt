\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comparative study of SAT solving algorithms, with a primary focus on Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) and the influence of branching heuristics on its performance. Classical methods such as Resolution, Davis-Putnam (DP) and Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) are reviewed for theoretical context, while the core analysis centers on CDCL and heuristic strategies. We implement and benchmark ORDERED, VSIDS, MINISAT-style activity, JEROSLOW-WANG, BERKMIN, and clause-size-based heuristics on both random 3-SAT problems and structured encodings of real-world tasks like hardware verification.

Experimental results show that while Resolution and DP suffer from rapid clause growth and limited scalability, and DPLL improves this only moderately, CDCL combined with well-designed heuristics delivers superior performance—especially on large and unsatisfiable instances. The data clearly demonstrate that branching heuristics are not minor optimizations but pivotal elements that shape solver efficiency and practical applicability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Motivation of the Problem}
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computer science, with applications in artificial intelligence, hardware verification, combinatorics, and bioinformatics \cite{biere2009handbook}. While early algorithms like resolution \cite{robinson1965} and Davis-Putnam (DP) \cite{davis1960computing} laid the groundwork for SAT solving, they often struggle with large, complex instances. The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm \cite{davis1962machine} improves DP's algorithm by introducing backtracking and recursive search. Building upon DPLL, Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) introduces clause learning and non-chronological backtracking \cite{silva2010empirical}, significantly improving efficiency, especially on large and unsatisfiable instances. This paper aims to address the gap in heuristic performance analysis by benchmarking various heuristics within the CDCL framework, focusing on structured SAT problems like Graph Coloring.

\subsection{Problem Description and Solution}
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) seeks to identify whether there exists a truth value assignment to variables that results in a valid Boolean formula. This study analyzes four methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resolution} applies inference rules to derive new clauses until a contradiction or solution emerges. While theoretically complete, it suffers from exponential clause growth in practice.
    
    \item \textbf{Davis–Putnam (DP)} eliminates variables through resolution and simplification. It improves on Resolution by systematically eliminating variables but still faces scalability issues.
    
    \item \textbf{DPLL} improves on DP using backtracking and unit propagation. It introduces a more efficient search strategy by exploring the solution space recursively and pruning invalid branches early.
    
    \item \textbf{CDCL} extends DPLL with conflict-driven clause learning and non-chronological backtracking. It represents the state-of-the-art by learning from conflicts and using sophisticated heuristics.
\end{itemize}

The key challenge in SAT solving lies in efficiently navigating the exponential search space. While all four methods are theoretically complete, their practical performance varies significantly. Resolution and DP struggle with clause explosion, while DPLL and CDCL employ more sophisticated search strategies. CDCL achieves superior performance through conflict analysis, non-chronological backtracking, advanced branching heuristics, and restart strategies.

We compare these algorithms using both uniformly generated 3-SAT instances and structured problems such as the Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) encoded into SAT. This dual approach allows us to evaluate solver performance across different problem types and identify the strengths and limitations of each method.

\subsection{Informal Example}

To illustrate how SAT solvers operate, consider the following 3-variable Boolean formula:

\[
(x_1 \lor \neg x_2 \lor x_3) \land (\neg x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \neg x_3) \land (x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \neg x_3)
\]

The goal is to assign truth values to \(x_1, x_2, x_3\) such that the entire formula is satisfied.

Solvers tackle this problem in distinct ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resolution} applies inference rules to derive new clauses until a contradiction or solution emerges, often creating many intermediate clauses.
    \item \textbf{Davis–Putnam (DP)} eliminates variables through resolution and simplification, but struggles with scalability.
    \item \textbf{DPLL} improves on DP using backtracking and unit propagation to prune the search space more efficiently.
    \item \textbf{CDCL} extends DPLL with conflict-driven clause learning and non-chronological backtracking, allowing the solver to avoid repeating the same mistakes and converge faster, especially on complex formulas.
\end{itemize}

This simple example shows how modern solvers, particularly CDCL-based ones, go beyond brute-force search by using learned information to accelerate decision-making.

\subsection{Originality of the Work}
This paper presents a unified SAT solving framework that allows multiple branching heuristics to be seamlessly integrated, tested, and compared under identical conditions. Unlike prior studies that typically evaluate heuristics in isolation \cite{jeroslow1990solving} or within specific solver implementations \cite{een2003extensible}, this work emphasizes side-by-side benchmarking across both synthetic and structured instances. The inclusion of graph-based encodings alongside random 3-SAT formulas highlights how heuristic behavior shifts with problem structure \cite{ansotegui2012structure}, offering a broader perspective on solver design and practical performance trade-offs.

\section{Formal Description}
\label{sec:formal}

\subsection{Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)}

Let $\phi$ be a propositional formula over a finite set of Boolean variables $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF), i.e., $\phi = C_1 \land C_2 \land \dots \land C_m$ where each clause $C_i$ is a disjunction of literals. A literal is either a variable $x_i$ or its negation $\lnot x_i$. The \emph{Boolean Satisfiability Problem} (SAT) asks whether there exists a truth assignment $\sigma: \{x_1, \dots, x_n\} \to \{\top, \bot\}$ such that $\phi(\sigma) = \top$.

\subsection{Uniform 3-SAT}

The Uniform 3-SAT problem is a special case of SAT where each clause contains exactly three literals chosen uniformly at random:

\[
\phi = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} (l_{i1} \lor l_{i2} \lor l_{i3}),
\]
where each \( l_{ij} \) is a literal selected uniformly from \( \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, \neg x_1, \neg x_2, \dots, \neg x_n \} \). 

\subsection{Graph Coloring Problem (GCP)}

Given an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \), the goal is to assign one of \( k \) colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Formally, the coloring function \( C : V \rightarrow \{1, 2, \dots, k\} \) must satisfy:

\[
\forall (u, v) \in E, \quad C(u) \ne C(v).
\]

\subsubsection{SAT Encoding}

We encode the GCP as a SAT problem by introducing Boolean variables. For each vertex \( v_i \in V \) and color \( c_j \in \{1, \dots, k\} \), define a variable \( x_{i,j} \) that is true if and only if vertex \( v_i \) is assigned color \( c_j \).

\vspace{1em}
\noindent The SAT encoding includes the following constraints:

\paragraph{Each vertex must be assigned exactly one color.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{At least one color per vertex:}
    \[
    \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \left( \bigvee_{j=1}^{k} x_{i,j} \right)
    \]
    \item \textit{At most one color per vertex:}
    \[
    \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \bigwedge_{1 \leq j < l \leq k} \left( \neg x_{i,j} \vee \neg x_{i,l} \right)
    \]
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Adjacent vertices must have different colors.}
\[
\bigwedge_{(i,l) \in E} \bigwedge_{j=1}^{k} \left( \neg x_{i,j} \vee \neg x_{l,j} \right)
\]

These constraints ensure that each vertex has a unique color and adjacent vertices do not share the same color \cite{walsh1993breaking}.

\subsubsection{Applications}

GCP has practical relevance in register allocation, frequency assignment, and timetabling/scheduling. The problem is NP-complete, but encoding it as SAT allows modern solvers to tackle large structured instances efficiently \cite{ansotegui2012structure}.

\subsection{SAT Solving Algorithms}

This section presents four prominent algorithms for solving the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT): Resolution \cite{robinson1965}, Davis–Putnam (DP) \cite{davis1960computing}, Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) \cite{davis1962machine}, and Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) \cite{marques1999grasp}. Each algorithm operates on formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), employing different techniques ranging from rule-based derivation to heuristic-guided search.

\subsubsection{Resolution Method}

\textbf{Definition:} The Resolution method is a refutation-based inference technique used to determine the unsatisfiability of a propositional formula by iteratively applying the resolution rule to pairs of clauses until the empty clause is derived \cite{robinson1965}.

\textbf{Resolution Rule:} Given two clauses \( C_1 = A \lor l \) and \( C_2 = B \lor \lnot l \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint sets of literals, their resolvent is:
\[
\text{Res}(C_1, C_2) = A \lor B
\]

\textbf{Procedure:} The algorithm begins by converting the input formula into CNF. It then iteratively applies the resolution rule to pairs of clauses, adding any new resolvents to the set of clauses. This process continues until either the empty clause is derived, indicating unsatisfiability, or no new clauses can be generated, suggesting satisfiability \cite{robinson1965}.

\textbf{Soundness and Completeness:} The resolution method is sound because each resolvent is a logical consequence of its parent clauses. It is complete for propositional logic, meaning that if a CNF formula is unsatisfiable, the empty clause will eventually be derived through resolution \cite{robinson1965}.

\textbf{Complexity:} The resolution method can lead to an exponential increase in the number of clauses, especially in cases like the pigeonhole principle. Consequently, while it is complete, its worst-case time complexity is exponential in the number of variables \cite{robinson1965}.

\subsubsection{Davis–Putnam (DP) Algorithm}

\textbf{Definition:} The Davis–Putnam algorithm enhances the resolution method by systematically eliminating variables through a combination of resolution and simplification techniques, such as the unit clause and pure literal rules \cite{davis1960computing}.

\textbf{Procedure:} After converting the formula to CNF, the algorithm applies simplification rules to reduce the formula. It then selects a variable and eliminates it by resolving all pairs of clauses containing the variable and its negation. This process repeats until all variables are eliminated or a contradiction is found \cite{davis1960computing}.

\textbf{Soundness and Completeness:} Each step in the DP algorithm preserves logical equivalence, ensuring soundness. The method is complete because it systematically eliminates all variables and exhaustively checks all consequences, guaranteeing the correct satisfiability result \cite{davis1960computing}.

\textbf{Complexity:} Similar to the resolution method, the DP algorithm can suffer from clause explosion, where variable elimination generates exponentially many resolvents. Therefore, its worst-case complexity remains exponential in the number of variables and clauses \cite{davis1960computing}.

\subsubsection{Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) Algorithm}

\textbf{Definition:} The DPLL algorithm extends the DP algorithm by introducing backtracking and recursive branching, enabling more efficient exploration of the search space and early pruning of invalid assignments \cite{davis1962machine}.

\textbf{Procedure:} The algorithm starts by simplifying the formula using unit clause and pure literal rules. It then selects an unassigned variable and recursively explores both possible assignments (true and false). If a contradiction is encountered, the algorithm backtracks and tries alternative assignments. This process continues until a satisfying assignment is found or all possibilities are exhausted \cite{davis1962machine}.

\textbf{Soundness and Completeness:} DPLL is sound because it only derives consequences based on valid assignments. It is complete, as it exhaustively searches over all possible assignments, using pruning via simplification and backtracking to reduce unnecessary computations \cite{davis1962machine}.

\textbf{Complexity:} In the worst case, DPLL explores a full binary tree of assignments, leading to exponential time complexity. However, the algorithm performs efficiently in practice due to effective heuristics and simplification techniques \cite{davis1962machine}.

\subsubsection{Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)}

\textbf{Definition:} CDCL extends DPLL by introducing conflict analysis, clause learning, non-chronological backtracking, and advanced branching heuristics such as VSIDS, JW, BerkMin, and MiniSAT \cite{marques1999grasp}.

\textbf{Procedure:} The algorithm begins by converting the formula to CNF and initializing an empty assignment. It then iteratively performs unit propagation and, upon encountering a conflict, analyzes it to learn a new clause. This learned clause is added to the formula, and the algorithm backtracks to an earlier decision level. The process continues with the selection of decision literals guided by heuristics until a satisfying assignment is found or unsatisfiability is determined \cite{marques1999grasp}.

\textbf{Soundness and Completeness:} CDCL is sound because it only derives consequences based on valid assignments and learned clauses that are logical consequences of the original formula. It is complete, as it exhaustively searches over all possible assignments, using clause learning and non-chronological backtracking to avoid redundant searches \cite{marques1999grasp}.

\textbf{Complexity:} In the worst case, CDCL has exponential time complexity. However, in practice, it performs efficiently due to effective heuristics, clause learning, and backjumping strategies \cite{marques1999grasp}.

\subsubsection{Branching Heuristics in CDCL SAT Solvers}
\label{sec:cdcl-heuristics}

Branching heuristics are crucial for the performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solvers. These heuristics guide variable assignments during the search process. We explore six key heuristics: Ordered, VSIDS, MiniSat's variant, Jeroslow-Wang, Berkmin, and CLS-Size.

\subsection*{Ordered Heuristic}

The Ordered heuristic assigns truth values to variables in a fixed order, typically based on their appearance in the input formula. This method does not adapt during the solving process and serves as a baseline for comparison. While simple, it often results in inefficient search strategies \cite{silva2010empirical}.

\subsection*{VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum)}

VSIDS assigns an activity score to each variable, which is incremented when the variable appears in a conflict clause \cite{moskewicz2001chaff}:

\[
\text{score}(x_i) \leftarrow \text{score}(x_i) + \Delta
\]

These scores are periodically decayed by a factor \( \alpha \):

\[
\text{score}(x_i) \leftarrow \alpha \cdot \text{score}(x_i)
\]

This heuristic prioritizes frequently involved variables, improving solver efficiency \cite{moskewicz2001chaff}.

\subsection*{MiniSat's Variant of VSIDS}

MiniSat improves VSIDS by adjusting the decay factor dynamically based on solver progress \cite{een2003extensible}:

\[
\text{score}(x_i) \leftarrow \text{score}(x_i) + \Delta \cdot \text{progress}(i)
\]

It also includes phase-saving, retaining variable polarity across restarts to reuse learned information \cite{een2004extensible}.

\subsection*{Jeroslow-Wang Heuristic}

The Jeroslow-Wang heuristic assigns a weight to each literal based on the length of clauses in which it appears \cite{jeroslow1990solving}:

\[
J(l) = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_l} 2^{-|c|}
\]

It prioritizes literals in shorter clauses, assuming they are more critical for pruning the search space \cite{jeroslow1990solving}.

\subsection*{Berkmin Heuristic}

The Berkmin heuristic adjusts variable selection based on recent conflicts and learned clauses \cite{goldberg2002berkmin}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Increase Scores:} When a conflict occurs, increase the score of the involved variables by \(\Delta\):
    \[
    \text{score}(x_i) \leftarrow \text{score}(x_i) + \Delta
    \]
   
    \item \textbf{Decay Scores:} Periodically reduce all variable scores by multiplying by a decay factor \( \alpha \):
    \[
    \text{score}(x_i) \leftarrow \alpha \times \text{score}
    \]

    
    \item \textbf{Select Variable:} The solver selects the variable with the highest score from the recent conflicts \cite{goldberg2002berkmin}:
    \[
    \text{selected variable} = \max_{x_i} \text{score}(x_i)
    \]
    where the \( \max \) operation selects the variable with the highest score among all variables.
\end{enumerate}

This process helps the solver focus on the most relevant variables and improves the efficiency of the search \cite{goldberg2002berkmin}.

\subsection*{CLS-Size Heuristic}

The CLS-Size heuristic prioritizes variables in smaller clauses, assuming these clauses are more useful for reducing the search space \cite{marques1999grasp}. The priority score is:

\[
\text{score}(x_i) = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{x_i}} \frac{1}{|c|}
\]

It focuses on efficiently identifying contradictions and pruning large portions of the search tree.

\section{Model and Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Problem Modeling}

SAT problems are typically represented in \textbf{Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)}, where a formula is a conjunction of clauses, each clause being a disjunction of literals \cite{biere2009handbook}.

In our implementation, CNF formulas are encoded using the \textbf{DIMACS} format, a standard textual representation with the following structure \cite{hoos2000satlib}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first line defines the problem: \texttt{p cnf \textit{[number of variables]} \textit{[number of clauses]}}.
  \item Each subsequent line represents a clause as a sequence of integers:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Positive integers denote variables.
    \item Negative integers denote their negations.
    \item Each clause ends with \texttt{0}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture}

    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking} (\texttt{benchmark.py}): The main script that runs the benchmarks and collects results from different SAT solvers. Implements the main interface for solving SAT problems. It handles the solving process, invoking the appropriate algorithm, and outputs the result.
    \item \textbf{Visualization} (\texttt{plot.py}): A script for visualizing benchmark results and solver performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection*{Resolution, DP, DPLL Implementation Details}

The Resolution and Davis-Putnam (DP) algorithms are implemented in their standard forms, while the DPLL algorithm has improved splitting heuristics (binary branching on the most frequently occurring variable).

\subsubsection*{CDCL Implementation Details}

The CDCL solver represents the core of our implementation and includes several advanced techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP)}: An efficient implementation using two-watched literals that maintains invariants to minimize clause traversal.
    
    \item \textbf{Conflict Analysis}: Implements First Unique Implication Point (1-UIP) learning, which has been shown to generate more effective conflict clauses than simpler schemes.
    
    \item \textbf{Backjumping}: Non-chronological backtracking that directly jumps to the highest decision level contributing to the conflict.
    
    \item \textbf{Restart Strategies}: Both Luby and geometric restart sequences are implemented to escape search plateaus.
    
    \item \textbf{Pluggable Heuristics}: A framework allowing different branching heuristics to be selected at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note:} Values in the table represent average solving time in seconds / the average number of splitting decisions taken. If a solver did not finish all tests, the format \texttt{X\% : T} indicates the percentage of instances solved and the corresponding average time, - respectively for all tests timed out.

\subsection{Results Interpretation}

Our benchmark results reveal several key insights about SAT solver performance:

\subsubsection*{Comparative Analysis of Solver Types}

The results confirm the historical evolution of SAT solving algorithms, with CDCL-based solvers consistently outperforming DPLL, which in turn outperforms DP, while Resolution fails to complete within reasonable time limits for all but the smallest instances. This progression reflects the cumulative improvements in search space pruning techniques, from Resolution's exhaustive approach to CDCL's sophisticated conflict analysis and non-chronological backtracking.

The performance gap between algorithms widens with problem size. For instance, on uf100-430 instances, CDCL solvers complete in under 0.1 seconds, while DP requires over 14 seconds, and Resolution fails to complete. This demonstrates the critical importance of efficient search space exploration in modern SAT solving.

\subsubsection*{CDCL Heuristic Performance Analysis}

Comparing decision heuristics within the CDCL framework:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JEROSLOW} demonstrates the best overall performance, requiring fewer decisions and less execution time on most benchmarks (e.g., 0.74s/1717 decisions on uf150-645). Its success stems from effectively identifying critical variables through clause size weighting.
    
    \item \textbf{VSIDS} performs competitively but typically requires more decisions than JEROSLOW (e.g., 1.70s/2489 decisions on uf150-645). Its strength lies in adapting to conflict patterns, though this adaptation comes at the cost of increased decision counts.
    
    \item \textbf{BERKMIN} excels on structured problems but is less efficient on random SAT instances, suggesting its clause recency focus works better with inherent problem structure.
    
    \item \textbf{MINISAT} performs well on medium-sized instances but struggles with scalability despite reasonable decision counts.
    
    \item \textbf{CLS\_SIZE} and \textbf{ORDERED} consistently underperform, with ORDERED's high decision counts (e.g., 8224 vs. JEROSLOW's 825 on uf125-538) demonstrating the inferiority of static variable ordering.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Correlation Between Decision Count and Execution Time}

The correlation between decision count and execution time varies across problem types and heuristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For smaller instances, there's a strong correlation between fewer decisions and faster execution times, as overhead from decision-making dominates.
    
    \item For larger instances, this correlation weakens. On uf175-753, JEROSLOW's decision-to-time ratio (5649/5.10s) is more efficient than VSIDS (10488/16.71s), suggesting differences in per-decision overhead and learning efficiency.
    
    \item On structured problems, BERKMIN sometimes makes more decisions than JEROSLOW yet executes faster, indicating variations in constraint propagation efficiency.
    
    \item For unsatisfiable instances, the correlation strengthens as these problems require more exhaustive search space exploration.
\end{itemize}

This non-linear relationship stems from decision-making overhead differences, varying clause learning efficiency, restart strategy interactions, memory access patterns, and problem structure influence on heuristic effectiveness.

\subsubsection*{Problem Structure Impact}

Problem structure significantly affects heuristic performance. On flat graph coloring instances, the performance gap between heuristics narrows, suggesting that optimal heuristic selection should be tailored to specific problem domains rather than universally applied. This is particularly evident in the flat200-479 instances, where all heuristics show similar scaling patterns despite different absolute performance levels.

These results demonstrate that while CDCL represents a significant advancement over earlier paradigms, the choice of decision heuristic remains crucial for optimal performance. The effectiveness of different heuristics varies not only with problem size but also with problem structure, highlighting the need for adaptive heuristic selection strategies in modern SAT solvers.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving has evolved significantly over decades, with major advances in algorithms and heuristics \cite{biere2009handbook}. Our work builds upon this history while providing a comprehensive comparative analysis.

\subsection{SAT Solving Algorithms}

The evolution of SAT solving has seen several paradigm shifts, from Davis and Putnam's original DP algorithm \cite{davis1960computing} to DPLL \cite{davis1962machine} and finally CDCL \cite{marques1999grasp}. Our implementation follows these core principles while incorporating modern optimizations \cite{moskewicz2001chaff}. Unlike implementations focusing solely on CDCL, our framework enables direct comparison of Resolution, DP, DPLL, and CDCL algorithms on the same benchmarks.

\subsection{Decision Heuristics}

Decision heuristics have been extensively studied in SAT solving. VSIDS \cite{moskewicz2001chaff} revolutionized variable selection in CDCL solvers, while Jeroslow-Wang \cite{jeroslow1990solving} proposed a scoring mechanism based on literal occurrences. BerkMin \cite{goldberg2002berkmin} introduced recency-based selection, and MiniSat \cite{een2003extensible} brought simplified but effective heuristics with phase saving. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of six different heuristics across diverse benchmarks, offering insights into their relative strengths.

\subsection{Benchmark Analysis}

The SATLIB benchmark library \cite{hoos2000satlib} provides standard instances for evaluation. Our work uses these established benchmarks alongside specialized families like flat graph coloring \cite{walsh1993breaking}, enabling analysis of problem structure's impact on heuristic selection \cite{ansotegui2012structure}. While many studies focus on either random or structured instances, our work bridges this gap by analyzing performance across both categories.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

Traditional evaluations focus on runtime, but as noted by Audemard and Simon \cite{audemard2018predicting}, decision counts can be more implementation-independent. Our work extends this by analyzing the correlation between decisions and runtime across heuristics, revealing non-linear relationships. We also connect learned clause patterns to heuristic selection, building on work by Elffers et al. \cite{elffers2018clause} and Liang et al. \cite{liang2016learning}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\subsection{Summary of Achievements}

This paper presented a comprehensive implementation and analysis of modern SAT solving techniques, with key contributions including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A unified framework implementing four major SAT solving paradigms, enabling direct comparison.
    \item Implementation of six different decision heuristics for CDCL solvers.
    \item Extensive empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks.
    \item Novel insights into the correlation between decision counts and runtime performance.
\end{itemize}

Our results confirm CDCL's advantage over earlier paradigms and highlight the critical role of decision heuristics. JEROSLOW demonstrated the best overall performance, while BERKMIN showed specialized strength on structured problems.

\subsection{Challenges and Solutions}

Key challenges included memory management for the two-watched literal scheme, benchmark diversity, performance measurement, and timeout handling. We addressed these through optimized data structures, expanded benchmark suites, detailed performance tracking, and robust timeout handling.

\subsection{Future Work}

Several promising directions for future work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developing hybrid heuristics that combine the strengths of multiple approaches.
    \item Implementing more sophisticated learned clause management strategies.
    \item Extending the framework to support parallel solving.
    \item Exploring machine learning integration for heuristic selection.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, while modern SAT solvers have made remarkable progress, significant opportunities remain for further optimization. Our work provides a foundation for future research by offering detailed insights into different solving approaches and identifying promising directions for improvement.
